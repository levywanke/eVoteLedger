## Overview
eVoteLedger is a secure, transparent, and decentralized voting system built on blockchain technology. This project aims to deliver a tamper-proof, user-friendly platform for conducting elections, ensuring fairness, transparency, and security for all participants.

## Features
- **Decentralized** ledger for recording votes
- **Immutable** voting records, ensuring data integrity
- **Transparent** and verifiable vote counting
- **Secure** user verification and authentication
- **React-based frontend** for an intuitive user interface

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain**: Smart contracts for vote management
- **Frontend**: React, with Web3.js or Ethers.js for blockchain interaction
- **Backend (Optional)**: Node.js for additional API endpoints or user data
- **Database (Optional)**: IPFS or any decentralized storage for records, if needed

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or other compatible wallets for blockchain access

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/eVoteLedger.git
   cd eVoteLedger
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Smart Contract Deployment** (assuming Solidity and Truffle or Hardhat)
   - Set up a local blockchain or connect to a testnet.
   - Deploy the smart contracts and note the deployed addresses for frontend configuration.

4. **Configure Frontend**
   - Update blockchain contract addresses and any necessary API endpoints in the frontend configuration files.

5. **Run the frontend**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Project Structure


## Usage
- Access the React app, connect a MetaMask wallet, and follow the instructions to cast a vote.
- Votes will be securely recorded on the blockchain, and results can be verified on-chain.
